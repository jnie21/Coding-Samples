# Coding-Samples
The attached file includes a group project and the code I contributed to its development. This report analyzes Chicago's crime trends, focusing on the correlation between crime categories, geographic locations, and seasonal fluctuations. Using data from the City of Chicago's public records, the analysis identifies critical factors influencing crime patterns. Actionable strategies for reducing crime rates are derived through spatial and temporal analysis techniques.

My code contributions primarily emphasize the following:

Combining data from two time periods to create a unified dataset for analysis;
Checking for missing values to assess dataset completeness;
Simplifying the dataset by focusing on relevant information;
Sampling to reduce data size for efficient visualization;
Preparing geographic data for mapping to provide context for crime locations;
Adding interactivity with a selector for filtering by year.
